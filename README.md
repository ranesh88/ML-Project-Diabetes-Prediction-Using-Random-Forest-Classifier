This project is related to Healthcare domain.

In this project we will predict the possibility of suffering with Diabetes based on the
health parameters such as Glucose, BMI, Insulin etc

This kind of work is useful in healthcare domain for predicting chance of diabetes for every patient. 
and taking preventive actions.

Important libraries that are useful for implementing this Machine Learning Algorithm are below mentioned::

sklearn (Scikit-learn):  sklearn is a core Python library providing a vast array of machine learning algorithms for tasks like classification, regression, clustering, model selection, and more.

matplotlib: The foundation of data visualization in Python, offering extensive tools to create static plots like line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, and many others.

seaborn: Built on top of matplotlib, seaborn provides a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and statistically rigorous plots that help you explore and understand your data more effectively.

Random Forest Classifier::

Random forest classifiers have proven effective in predicting diabetes by analyzing various factors such as patient demographics, medical history, and biomarkers.
By leveraging the ensemble learning technique and combining multiple decision trees, random forest models can provide accurate predictions of diabetic risk, aiding in early detection and personalized treatment strategies.

Random forests are a powerful machine learning technique that belongs to the family of ensemble methods. Ensemble methods combine multiple individual models (in this case, decision trees) to produce a stronger, more reliable final result.
Random forests are used for supervised learning tasks, specifically classification problems. This means they learn from a dataset where each example has a known label or class that they try to predict.
In essence, random forests create a large number of decision trees, train them on different parts of the data, and then let them "vote" on the most likely class for a new data point.

This is how Random Forests Work:

Each decision tree in the forest is trained on a random subset of the original dataset. This process is called bootstrapping, which means selecting samples with replacement.
At each step when a decision tree is splitting a node, it only considers a random subset of features. This introduces diversity in the trees.
This process of random sampling and decision tree building is repeated many times, creating the "forest" of trees.
To classify a new example, it's passed through each tree in the forest. Each tree makes a prediction, and the final class is determined by majority vote (most frequent prediction wins).

Here are some Advantages of Random Forest:

1. They are less prone to overfitting than individual decision trees, reducing problems with excessive tailoring to training data.
2. Because of their ensemble nature, they often deliver highly accurate  predictions.
3. Random forests can effectively handle datasets with missing values.
4. They can capture complex, non-linear patterns in the data.
5. They provide a way to assess the relative importance of each feature in the classification process.
